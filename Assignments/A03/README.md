### Assignment 3- Frequency Analysis
### Arshia Clare

Project Description: 
I received two files that were encrypted using a "substitution" cipher. The genius whom encrypted these, randomly shuffled a list of letters multiple times. The problem is, he never sent me the key! So, I cannot reverse the process. I need your help to decipher these messages. So the only way to get these two messages vital to the safety of earth is to run a frequency analysis on them. Below is a typical frequency distribution for you to work with.

Using frequency analysis to decipher the 2 encrypted texts. 
First encrypted text was easier to decipher because the first four highest frequency letters matched the graph's four highest letter.
Second encrypted text had the first two highest frequency letters matched the graph's two highest letter and the fourth matched.
After some letters were identified, it was easier to decipher two and three letter words. I used Microsoft Word to replace non-highlighted letters(not replaced) to highlights letters(replaced), so nonreplaced and replaced letters won't mix.
